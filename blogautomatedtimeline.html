        <p>Efficient project planning and scheduling are crucial for successful project management. One of the key components in this process is creating a timeline or schedule that outlines the tasks, milestones, and dependencies. Traditionally, this has been a manual and time-consuming task, but with the advent of automated features, project managers now have the ability to streamline and expedite this process.</p>

        <p>In this blog post, we will explore QuoteX's <strong>"Create Timeline/Schedule From Scope(s)"</strong> feature and its transformative impact on project planning.</p>

        <h2>Flexibility and Customization</h2>
        <p>While the current version of the feature supports creating timelines with a weekly frequency, it still offers a considerable degree of flexibility and customization. Project managers can adapt the timeline to match the unique requirements of their projects, considering factors such as task complexity, resource availability, and project deadlines.</p>

        <p>By allowing customization, this feature empowers project managers to create accurate and tailored timelines that reflect the specific needs of their projects.</p>
